\section{Background}


In  2016, the UK's consumer protection organisation, called ``Which?'', submitted a super-complaint to the ``Financial Conduct Authority'' (FCA) about the APP frauds. It raised its concerns that, despite the APP frauds' victims rate is significantly growing, the victims do not have enough protection \cite{Which?-super-complaint}.  Since then, the FCA has been collaborating with financial institutes  to develop a number of initiatives thatcould help prevent these frauds, and improve the response when they  occur. As a result,  the ``Contingent Reimbursement Model'' (CRM) code has been proposed. The  CRM code  lays out a set of requirements and explains under which circumstances customers should be reimbursed by their trading financial institutes, when they fall victim to an APP fraud \cite{CRM-code}. So far,  there are at least nine firms, comprising nineteen brands (e.g., Barclays, HSBC,  Lloyds) signed up to the CRM code.
