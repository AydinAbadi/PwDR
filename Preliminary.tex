\item[$\bullet$] Bank ($\mathcal{B}$): it is a regular bank providing online banking. We assume it is corrupted by a non-colluding active adversary. Note that in the real world a bank is not usually an active adversary and cares about its reputation, such as a ``rational'' or ``covert'' adversary which is weaker than the active one. However, to ensure our solution offers a strong security guarantee, we assume the adversary is strong too, i.e., active one. We also assume any change to the online banking system's source code is transparent and can be detected.

\item[$\bullet$] Smart contract ($\mathcal{S}$): it is a standard smart contract of a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum). It mainly acts as a tamper-proof public bulletin board to store different parties' messages.  %We do not assume that a smart contract itself can offer any privacy.

 We assume they   interacted with each  other once,  to agree on a secret key, $\bar k_{\st 0}$, and a pair of keys $({pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, {sk}_{\st\mathcal {D}})$  of an asymmetric key encryption.
%
\item[$\bullet$]  Dispute resolver ($\mathcal{DR}$): it is an aggregator of auditors' votes (e.g., public court). Given a collection of votes, it extracts and announces the final verdict. We assume it is corrupted by a non-colluding passive adversary. We assume $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal B$  use a secure channel when they send a message directly to $\mathcal{DR}$.

%\subsection{Notations}
%We use $\mathtt{Enc}(.)$  and $\mathtt{Dec}(.)$ to denote the encrypting and decrypting algorithms of   a semantically secure symmetric key encryption scheme respectively. We also use  $\mathtt{ \tilde {Enc}}({pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, .)$ and   $\mathtt{\tilde{Dec}}({sk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, .)$ to denote the encrypting and decrypting algorithms of   a semantically secure asymmetric key encryption scheme  which has  the following key generating algorithm:  $\tilde{\mathtt{keyGen}}(1^{\st\lambda})\rightarrow({sk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, {pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}})$ and its  public key, ${pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}$, is known to everyone.  We denote the banking system's internal payment  algorithm by  $\mathtt{pay}(.)$ that  transfers money from the customer's account to a payee's account that is specified by the customer.  We use $in_{\st p}$ to denote the inputs of this algorithm.  We also use $\phi$ to denote a null value. In Appendix \ref{sec:notation-table}, we provide a notation table. 


%We use $\mathtt{Enc}(.)$  and $\mathtt{Dec}(.)$ to denote the encrypting and decrypting algorithms of   a semantically secure symmetric key encryption scheme. In this work, we use a committee of honest arbiters $\mathcal{D}:\{\mathcal{D}_{\st 1},..., \mathcal{D}_{\st n}\}$. Each arbiter,  given a set of  inputs, provides a binary verdict.    We  assume  $\mathcal{D}_{\st i}$'s share a pair of keys $({pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, {sk}_{\st\mathcal {D}})$ of an asymmetric key encryption. The encryption scheme has  key generating  $\tilde{\mathtt{keyGen}}(1^{\st\lambda})\rightarrow({sk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, {pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}})$,   encrypting $\mathtt{ \tilde {Enc}}({pk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, .)$ and  decrypting $\mathtt{\tilde{Dec}}({sk}_{\st\mathcal {D}}, .)$ algorithms, where its public key is known to everyone.  Also, we assume all arbiters have interacted with each other to agree on a secret key, $\bar k_{\st 0}$.  In this work, a third party dispute resolver, $\mathcal{DR}$, is involved, which can be potentially semi-honest, i.e., a passive adversary. We assume bank and customer are potentially malicious, i.e., active adversary. We use $\phi$ to denote a null value.  Our proposed solution is built upon the existing online banking system. We assume the banking system has  algorithm  $\mathtt{pay}(.)$ that  transfers money from the customer's account to a payee's account that is specific by the customer.  We denote the inputs of this algorithm $in_{\st p}$. We assume the source code of the online banking system is static, and any change to the source code is transparent and  can be detected, e.g., the bank  uses a cryptographic commitment to commit to the source code. Moreover, we assume the online banking  system is secure. In Appendix \ref{sec:notation-table}, we provide a notation table. 





% Similar to the \emph{optimistic} fair cryptographic protocols that aim  at efficiency, e.g., in \cite{AsokanSW97,eurocrypt/AsokanSW98,BaoDM98,DongCCR13}, we assume the existence of a trusted third party arbiter   which remains offline most of the time but can be invoked to resolve a part of dispute. We emphasise that if the bank and customers behave honestly, then the arbiter is never involved. Even the (offline) presence of such an arbiter threatens adversarial behaviour and acts as a deterrence.  %The idea is akin to deterrence in criminology,  i.e.,  the threat of punishment will deter people from committing crimes.














\subsection{Digital Signature}\label{subsec:DS}

A digital signature is a scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages. Below, we restate its formal definition, taken from \cite{DBLP:books/crc/KatzLindell2014}. 


\begin{definition}\label{sec::def}
A signature scheme  involves three algorithms, $\mathtt{Signature}:=(\mathtt{Sig.keyGen}, $ $\mathtt{Sig.sign}, \mathtt{Sig.ver})$, that are defined as follows.

\begin{itemize} 
\item[$\bullet$] $\mathtt{Sig.keyGen}(1^{\st \lambda})\rightarrow (sk,pk)$.  A probabilistic algorithm run by  a  signer. It takes as input a security parameter. It outputs a key pair $(sk,pk)$, consisting of secret key $sk$, and public key $pk$. 
\item[$\bullet$] $\mathtt{Sig.sign}(sk, pk, u)\rightarrow sig$. An algorithm run by the signer. It takes as input  key pair $(sk,pk)$, and a message $u$. It outputs a signature $sig$.
\item[$\bullet$]  $\mathtt{Sig.ver}( pk, u, sig)\rightarrow h\in\{0,1\}$. A deterministic algorithm run by a verifier. It takes as input  public key  $pk$,  message $u$, and signature $sig$. It checks the signature's validity.   If the verification passes, then it outputs $1$; otherwise, it outputs $0$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

A digital signature scheme should meet the following properties:

\begin{itemize} 
\item[$\bullet$]  \textit{Correctness.} For every input $u$ it holds that:
%
$$Pr\Big[\  \  \mathtt{Sig.ver}( pk, u, \mathtt{Sig.sign}(sk, pk, u))=1\ : \
\mathtt{Sig.keyGen}(1^{\st \lambda})\rightarrow (sk, pk)  \Big]=1$$
%
\item[$\bullet$] \textit{Existential unforgeability under chosen message attacks.} A probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) adversary that obtains $pk$ and has access to a signing  oracle for messages of its choice, cannot create a valid pair $(u^{\st *},sig^{\st *})$ for a new message $u^{\st *}$  (that was never a query to the signing oracle), except with a small probability, $\sigma$. More formally: 




\small{
$$ \Pr\left[
  \begin{array}{l}
  
  u^{\st *}\not\in Q\ \wedge \\
   \mathtt{Sig.ver}( pk,  u^{\st *}, sig^{\st *}) =1\\
  
  
    
%(M(u^{\scriptscriptstyle *},k)\neq \sigma \lor Q(\text{aux},k)\neq q) \wedge\\ (a=1 \ \vee b=1)
\end{array} : 
    \begin{array}{l}
   
    \mathtt{Cer.keyGen}(1^{\st \lambda})\rightarrow (sk,pk) \\
  \mathcal{A}^{\mathtt{Sig.sign}(k,)}(pk)\rightarrow(u^{\st *}, sig^{\st *})

     
\end{array}    \right]\leq \mu(\lambda)$$
}
where $Q$ is the set of queries that $\mathcal{A}$ sent to the certificate generator oracle.
\end{itemize}



%
%An application of a digital signature is in digital certificate, which is a  document digitally signed  by a certificate generator. Given a certificate and its parameters,  anyone can check whether it has been correctly generated by a valid generator. There is a case  where 
%a \emph{hard copy} certificate is used.  In this case,  the process $\mathtt{Sig.keyGen}(.)$ outputs a blank legitimate stamped certificate as a private parameter: $sk$, and the description of a standard legitimate certificate as a public parameter: $pk$. Moreover, the process $\mathtt{Sig.sign}(k, u)$ takes $k$ and the file $u$ on which a certificate should be generated and outputs a stamped certificate with the information printed on it. The process $\mathtt{Sig.ver}( pk, u, sig)$ takes the public parameter, the file,  and the hard copy of the certificate and outputs $1$ if it is valid and $0$ if it is not. Note, when  a hard copy certificate is considered, it is not possible to precisely define the success probability of the adversary, as it depends on the technology available to the adversary to generate a blank stamped certificate that looks like a legitimate one. In the real world however, this probability is usually small (but it may not be negligible). In this paper, we mainly consider a digital certificate; however, our solution can adopt hard copy certificates as well with the above caveat  regarding the adversary's success probability. 



\subsection{Smart Contract}\label{subsec:SC} Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin \cite{bitcoin} and Ethereum \cite{ethereum}, beyond offering a decentralised currency,  support  computations on  transactions. In this setting, often a certain computation logic is encoded in a computer program, called a \emph{``smart contract''}. Although Bitcoin, the first decentralised cryptocurrency, supports smart contracts, the functionality of Bitcoin's smart contracts is very limited, due to the use of the underlying programming language that does not support arbitrary tasks. To address this limitation, Ethereum, as a generic smart contract platform, was designed. Thus far, Ethereum has been the most predominant cryptocurrency framework that lets users define arbitrary smart. This framework allows users to create an account with a unique account number or address. Such users are often called external account holders, which can send (or deploy) their contracts to the framework’s blockchain. In this framework, a contract's code and its related data  are held by every node in the blockchain's network. Ethereum smart contracts are often written in a high-level Turing-complete programming language called ``Solidity''.The program execution's  correctness  is  guaranteed by the security of the underlying blockchain components. To prevent  a denial of service attack, the framework requires a transaction creator to pay a  fee, called \emph{``gas''}. %, depending on the complexity of the contract running on  it.

\subsection{Pseudorandom Function}


Informally, a pseudorandom function is a deterministic function that takes a key of length $\Lambda$ and an input; and outputs a value  indistinguishable from that of  a truly random function.  In this paper, we use the pseudorandom function:   $\mathtt {PRF}: \{0,1\}^{\st \Lambda}\times \{0,1\}^{\st *} \rightarrow  \mathbb{F}_p$, where $p$ is a large prime number, $|p|=\lambda$, and $(\Lambda,\lambda)$ are the security parameters. In practice, a pseudorandom function can be obtained from an efficient block cipher. We refer readers to \cite{DBLP:books/crc/KatzLindell2014} for a formal definition of a pseudorandom function.



\subsection{Bloom Filter}\label{sec::bloom-filter-}

A Bloom filter \cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Bloom70} is a compact data structure for probabilistic efficient  elements'  membership checking. A Bloom filter is an array of $\bar  m$ bits that are initially all set to zero. It  represents $\bar n$  elements.  A Bloom filter comes along with  $\bar k$ independent hash functions. To insert an element, all the hash values of the element are computed and their corresponding bits in the filter are set to $1$. To check an element's membership, all its hash values are re-computed and checked whether all are set to one in the filter. If all the corresponding bits are one, then the element is probably in the filter; otherwise, it is not. In Bloom filters false positives are possible, i.e., it is possible that an element is not in the set, but the membership query shows that it is. According to \cite{BoseGKMMMST08}, the upper bound of the false positive probability is: $ q=\bar p^{\scriptscriptstyle \bar  k}(1+O(\frac{\bar k}{\bar p}\sqrt{\frac{\ln \bar m - \bar k \ln   \bar p}{\bar m}}))$,  where $\bar p$ is the probability that a particular bit in the filter is set to $1$ and calculated as: $ \bar p=1-(1-\frac{1}{\bar m})^{\scriptscriptstyle \bar k\bar n}$. The efficiency of a Bloom filter depends
on  $\bar m$ and $\bar k$. The lower bound of $\bar m$  is $\bar  n \log_{\scriptscriptstyle 2}
\bar e \cdot\log_{\scriptscriptstyle 2} \frac{1}{q}$, where $\bar e$ is the base of natural logarithms,  while the optimal number of hash functions is    $\log_{\scriptscriptstyle 2} \frac{1}{ q}$, when $\bar m$ is optimal. In this paper, we only use optimal $\bar k$ and $\bar m$. In practice, we would like to have a predefined acceptable upper bound on false positive probability, e.g., $ q=2^{\scriptscriptstyle - 40}$, and can adjust such a parameter. Given $ q$ and $\bar n$, we can determine the rest of the parameters.  Also, we require that a Bloom filter uses \emph{cryptographic} hash functions.


%\subsection{Pseudorandom Function}\label{subsec:PRF}
%
%Informally, a pseudorandom function ($\mathtt{PRF}$) is a deterministic function that takes as input a key and some argument and outputs a value  indistinguishable from that of a truly random function with the same domain and range.  Pseudorandom functions have many applications in cryptography as they provide an efficient and deterministic way to turn  input into a value that looks random. Below, we restate the formal definition of $\mathtt{PRF}$, taken from \cite{DBLP:books/crc/KatzLindell2007}. 
%
%\begin{definition} Let $W:\{0,1\}^{\st\psi}\times \{0,1\}^{\st \eta}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^{\st  \iota}$ be an efficient  keyed function. It is said $W$ is a pseudorandom function if for all probabilistic polynomial-time distinguishers $B$, there is a negligible function, $\mu(.)$, such that:
%
%\begin{equation*}
%\bigg | \Pr[B^{\st W_{\hat{k}}(.)}(1^{\st \psi})=1]- \Pr[B^{\st \omega(.)}(1^{\st \psi})=1] \bigg |\leq \mu(\psi)
%\end{equation*}
%where  the key, $\hat{k}\stackrel{\st\$}\leftarrow\{0,1\}^{\st\psi}$, is chosen uniformly at random and $\omega$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set of functions mapping $\eta$-bit strings to $\iota$-bit strings.
%\end{definition}



%\subsection{Bloom Filter}
%
%
%A Bloom filter \cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Bloom70} is a compact data structure that allows us to 
%efficiently check an  element membership. It is an array of $m$ bits (initially all set to zero), that  represents $n$  elements. It is accompanied by $k$ independent hash functions. To insert an element, all the  hash values of the element are computed and their corresponding bits in the filter are set to $1$. To check an element membership, all its hash values are re-computed and checked whether all are set to $1$ in the filter. If all the corresponding bits are $1$, then the element is probably in the filter; otherwise, it is not. In Bloom filters,  it is possible that an element is not in the set, but the membership query indicates it is, i.e., false positives. In this work, we ensure that the false positive probability is negligible, e.g.,  $2^{\st - 40}$. Also, we require that a Bloom filter uses \emph{cryptographic} hash functions. In Appendix \ref{sec::bloom-filter-}, we explain how the Bloom filter's parameters can be set.

%Informally, a digital certificate's security requires that no one can generate a valid certificate that was not previously produced by the certificate generator. The security of a digital certificate relies on the security of the digital signature scheme used.  Below, we present the formal definition of the digital signature.



%In the case where a digital certificate is considered, then $\mathtt{Cer}$ definition is equivalent to the definition of a digital signature scheme. In this case, it holds $\sigma=neg(\lambda)$, where $neg$ is a negligible function and $\lambda$ is a security parameter. Now, we briefly explain the procedures' input/output when a hard copy certificate is considered.  The process $\mathtt{Cer.genPar}(.)$ outputs a blank legitimate stamped certificate as a private parameter: $sk$, and the description of a standard legitimate certificate as a public parameter: $pk$. Morevoer, the process $\mathtt{Cer.genCrt}(k, u)$ takes $k$ and the file $u$ on which a certificate should be generated and outputs a stamped certificate with the information printed on it. The process $\mathtt{Cer.verCrt}( pk, u, crt)$ takes the public parameter, the file,  and the hard copy of the certificate and outputs $1$ if it is valid and $0$ if it is not. In the case where a hard copy certificate is considered, it is not possible to precisely define the probability $\sigma$, as it depends on the technology available to the adversary to generate a blank stamped certificate that looks like a legitimate one. In the real world however, this probability is usually small (but it may not be negligible).
