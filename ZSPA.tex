\subsubsection{Verdict Encoding-Decoding Protocols.}


In this section, we present efficient (verdict) encoding and decoding protocols. The encoding protocol  lets each of the $n$ honest arbiters $\mathcal{D}:\{\mathcal{D}_{\st 1},..., \mathcal{D}_{\st n}\}$ non-interactively encode its verdict such that a third party party $\mathcal{I}$ (where $\mathcal{I}\notin \mathcal{D}$),  given individual encoded verdict,  cannot learn anything about each arbiter's verdict.  The decoding protocol lets  $\mathcal{I}$ combine the encoded verdicts and learn either an specific final verdict  (i.e., $v=0$ or $v=1$) if  all arbiters' verdicts are identical, or  nothing  about the arbiters' inputs if they did not agree on the same specific verdict. The protocols are  primarily  based on ``zero-sum pseudorandom polynomials'' and the techniques often used by private set intersection (PSI) protocols. In particular, the arbiters only once for all customers agree on a secret key of a pseudorandom function. This key will allow each of them to generate a pseudorandom masking polynomial such that if all masking polynomials are summed up, they would cancel out each other and result $0$, i.e., zero-sum pseudorandom polynomials. 



%In this section, we present efficient (verdict) encoding and decoding protocols. The encoding protocol  lets each of the $n$ honest arbiters $\mathcal{D}:\{\mathcal{D}_{\st 1},..., \mathcal{D}_{\st n}\}$ non-interactively encode its verdict such that a third party party $\mathcal{I}$ (where $\mathcal{I}\notin \mathcal{D}$) can extract final verdict if  all arbiters' verdicts are identical with the following security requirements. First,  given individual encoded verdict, $\mathcal{I}$ cannot learn anything about each arbiter's verdict. Second, can find out only final verdict if  all arbiters' verdicts are identical; otherwise, it cannot learn each individual arbiter's verdict.  The decoding protocol lets  $\mathcal{I}$,  combines the encoded verdicts and learn either an specific final verdict  (i.e., $w=0$ or $w=1$) if  all arbiters' verdicts are identical, or  nothing  about the arbiters' inputs if they did not agree on the same specific verdict. The protocols are  primarily  based on ``zero-sum pseudorandom polynomials'' and the techniques often used by private set intersection (PSI) protocols. In particular, the arbiters only once for all customers agree on a secret key of a pseudorandom function. This key will allow each of them to generate a pseudorandom masking polynomial such that if all masking polynomials are summed up, they would cancel out each other and result $0$, i.e., zero-sum pseudorandom polynomials. 

At a high level, the protocols work as follows. To encode a verdict $w$, each arbiter represents it as a polynomial. It randomises this polynomial and then  masks this polynomial with the pseudorandom masking polynomial. It sends the result to $\mathcal{I}$. To decode the final verdict and find out whether all arbiters agreed on the same verdict, i.e., unanimous decision,  $\mathcal{I}$  adds all polynomials up. This removes the masks. Next, it  evaluates the result polynomial at $v=1$ and $v=0$. It considers $v$ as the final verdict if the evaluation is  $0$. We present the encoding  and decoding protocols in figures \ref{fig:PVE} and \ref{fig:FVD} respectively. 









%
%Below, we present ``Zero-sum Pseudorandom Values Generator'' (ZPVG), an algorithm that allows each of the $n$ arbiters  to \emph{efficiently} and \emph{independently}  generate a vector of $m$ pseudorandom values for each customer, such that when all arbiters' vectors are summed up component-wise, it would result in a vector of $m$ zeros. ZPVG is based on  the following idea. Each arbiter $\mathcal{D}_{\st j}\in\{\mathcal{D}_{\st 1},..., \mathcal{D}_{\st n-1}\}$  uses the secret key $\bar k_{\st 0}$ (as defined in Section \ref{Notations-and-Assumptions}), along with the customer's unique ID (e.g., it blockchain account's address) as the inputs of $\mathtt{PRF}(.)$  to derive $m$ pseudorandom values. However,  $\mathcal{D}_{\st n}$ generates each  $j$-th element of  its vector by computing the additive inverse of the sum of the $j$-th elements that the rest of arbiters generated. Even $\mathcal{D}_{\st n}$ does not need to interact with other arbiters, as it can regenerate their values too. Moreover, the arbiters do not need to interact with each other for every   new customer and can   reuse the same key because the new customer would have a new unique ID that would result in a fresh set of pseudorandom values (with a high probability). Figure \ref{fig:ZSPA} presents ZPVG in more detail. 





%It sends the result to all parties which can locally check if the relation holds. Note, in the literature,   there exist protocols that allows parties to agree on zero-sum pseudorandom values, e.g., in \cite{}; however, they are less efficient than $\mathtt{ZSPA}$, as their security requirements are different than ours, i.e., they assume the participants are malicious whereas we assume the arbiters who participate in this protocol  are honest. 


%Next, it commits to each value, where it uses $k_{\st 2}$ to generate the randomness of each commitment. Then, it constructs a Merkel tree on top of the commitments and  stores only the root of the tree  and the hash value of the keys (so in total three values) in  the smart contract.  Then, each party (using the keys) locally checks if the values and commitments have been constructed correctly; if so, each sends  an ``approved" message to the contract. 
%
%
%
%Informally, there are three main security requirements that $\mathtt{ZSPA}$ must meet: (a) privacy, (b)  non-refutability, and (c) indistinguishability. Privacy here means given the state of the  contract, an external party cannot learn any information about any of the (pseudorandom) values:  $z_{\st j}$; while non-refutability  means that if a party sends ``approved" then in future cannot deny the knowledge  of the values whose representation is stored in the contract. Furthermore, indistinguishability means that every $z_{\st j}$ ($1\leq j \leq m$) should be indistinguishable from a truly random value. In Fig. \ref{fig:ZSPA}, we provide $\mathtt{ZSPA}$ that efficiently generates $b$ vectors  where each vector elements is sum to zero.

Arbiter $\mathcal{D}_{\st j}$ takes the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item\label{ZSPA:val-gen} computes three pseudorandom coefficients of a degree-$2$ polynomial, $\Psi_{\st j}$, as follows.

By the end of this phase, a random polynomial of the following form is generated, $\Psi_{\st j}=r_{\st i+2,j}\cdot x^{\st 2}+r_{\st i+1,j}\cdot x+r_{\st i,j}$.
%
\item generates   a polynomial that encodes the verdict, i.e., $\Omega_{\st j}=(x-w)$.  

\item multiplies the polynomial by a fresh random polynomial $\Phi_{\st j}$ of degree $1$ and adds the result with $\Psi_{\st j}$, i.e.,  $\bar\Omega_{\st j}=\Phi_{\st j}\cdot \Omega_{\st j}+\Psi_{\st j}\bmod p$. 


\item  evaluates the result  polynomial, $\bar\Omega_{\st j}$, at every  element $x_{\scriptscriptstyle i}\in {\bm{x}}$. This yields a vector of   $y$-coordinates: $[ \bar w_{\st 1,j},..., \bar w_{\st 3,j}]$.

 $$\forall i, 1\leq i\leq 3: g_{\st i}=\sum\limits^{\st n}_{\st j=1} \bar{w}_{\st i,j} \bmod p$$
